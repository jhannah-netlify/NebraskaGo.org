<h2 id="what-is-go">What is Go?</h2>
<p>GO – It’s more than a game. It’s a game-changer.</p>
<p>We promote Go, not only because it’s fun to play, but because it
creates better students and better citizens, leading to better
communities.</p>
<p><em>“When I was young… I wanted to be the world’s best Go
player”</em><br/> –Bill Gates Speaks: Insights from the World’s Most
Successful Entrepreneur, p. 227.</p>
<p>Go is an ancient easy-to-learn strategy game. It is played with black
and white stones on a grid. <strong>Simple rules</strong> can be <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP63zfY-FM0&amp;ab_channel=WorldGoChannel">learned
in a few minutes</a>, even by children as young as four.
<strong>Handicapping system</strong> allows children to play with adults
and beginners to play with experts.</p>
<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Because Go benefits both the individual and the community, the
mission of the Nebraska GO Advisory Council is to promote the fun,
engaging, fascinating, and educationally-beneficial game of Go in and
near the state of Nebraska. Hopefully, our existence and, moreover, our
success will be an inspiration to Go promoters beyond Nebraska.</p>
<p>Research done in both the USA and South Korea has proven that playing
Go significantly IMPROVES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Performance</li>
<li>Task Concentration Span (“Attention”)</li>
<li>Delaying Gratification (“Patience”)</li>
<li>Problem-Solving Ability</li>
<li>It also increases Social Interaction and DECREASES Problem
Behavior</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Who wouldn’t want to live in a community with students and adults
with the above improved abilities?</em></p>
<h2 id="vision-statement">Vision Statement</h2>
<p>To promote Go in Nebraska and the surrounding areas by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating “Go Awareness” in the general population by exposing others
to the game, so that it is as recognizable as other popular board games,
like Checkers or Chess.</li>
<li>Teaching others about Go and how to play Go.</li>
<li>Encouraging and facilitating the teaching and playing of Go.</li>
<li>Sharing the Educational and Communal Benefits and Cultural and
Historical significance of the game of Go with others, especially with
educators and parents.</li>
<li>Helping to create self-sustaining Go clubs, especially at K-12
schools, libraries, community centers, YMCAs, and colleges.</li>
<li>Creating enough Go players and Go clubs that the NGAC is no longer
necessary and can, therefore, cease to exist, as the number of Go
players and Go clubs will fulfill the mission of the NGAC on their
own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cooperation</strong> – To promote our vision, we look forward
to working with other passionate, like-minded, individuals and
organizations, including, but not limited to, the American Go Foundation
(<a href="https://www.agfGo.org">www.agfGo.org</a>). We are not
interested in duplicating other organizations’ efforts, but in
complementing and enhancing them. Please note that we are always looking
for new NGAC members. Ask for an application form (<a
href="mailto:jm9st9@gmail.com">jm9st9@gmail.com</a>).</p>
<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<p>FREE Go starter sets are available from the American Go Foundation
(<a href="https://www.agfGo.org">www.agfGo.org</a>) for any K-12 school,
library, YMCA, or community center. Ask about their home-schooling
program.</p>
<p>Fun Facts about Go</p>
<ul>
<li>In Japan, Korea, and China, there are 24-hour cable TV stations just
for this game.</li>
<li>Professional Go players can make over $1 million per year.</li>
<li>At Myongji University in South Korea, you can get a college degree
just in this game.</li>
<li>Until 2016, Go was the last game at which humans could still beat
computers.</li>
<li>In the first part of hi book, “On China”, Dr. Henry Kissinger
(Secretary of State under President Nixon) devotes four pages just to
the game Go.</li>

<h2 id="go-vs-chess-which-is-better">Go vs Chess – which is better?</h2>
<p>Jim Story, 4/3/2025</p>
<p>Obviously, avid Go players and avid Chess players will have their own
opinions. I, personally, have played both games seriously (for example,
I’ve played in both Go and Chess tournaments). I am currently the
Organizer of the Omaha Go Club and, in 1994, was the President of the
Memphis, TN, Chess Club. However, if you’re considering starting
<em>either</em> a scholastic Go <em>or</em> Chess club, I suggest a Go
club, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Go uses more of the brain</strong> – fMRI (functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies show that Go uses more of the brain
than Chess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handicapping system</strong> – Unlike Chess, Go has a
simple handicapping system that allows adults to play with kids and
experts to play with beginners, without changing the “feel” or “flavor”
of the game. This allows a close exciting game in which both players
have an equal chance of winning, whatever their skills levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Go is easier to learn</strong> - The rules of Go are
simpler than the rules of Chess, so it’s easier to learn. This is
especially important for younger children. For example, in Go, there is
only one “piece”, the stone. Stones are placed on the board one at a
time and, once placed, are not moved. By comparison, in Chess, there are
five pieces: king, queen, bishop, knight, and rook, plus the pawns. All
move differently. And, there are many special rules, like castling, en
passant capturing, pawn promotion, and, while pawns move forward, they
can only capture diagonally. Go, by comparison, has only two
easily-understandable special rules: You cannot make a move that results
in either the capture of your own stones, or one that duplicates that
previous position.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eventual greater complexity</strong> – Go can be played
on different sized boards. The larger the board, the longer the game
takes and the more complex is the interaction between different battles
on the board. This is what makes it both exciting and challenging. On
the tournament board (a grid of 19 x 19, which is five times the size of
a Chess board), Go is estimated to be four times as complex as Chess.
You can play a quick and simple game of Go on a small board (e.g., on a
9 x 9). But, as Go players advance, they like to play on larger-sized
boards, which makes for a more complex and, therefore, more challenging
and exciting game.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, hopefully, you can start both a Go and a Chess club at
your school. However, if you can only start one, I strongly suggest
starting a Go club. Lastly, if you don’t start a Go club, then, by all
means, please start a Chess club.</p>
