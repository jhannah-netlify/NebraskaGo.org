<h2>What is GO?</h2>
</section>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><img src="image2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>(The Rules of GO are at the bottom of this page)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>GO is an ancient, easy-to-learn, and fun to play strategy
game.</strong> It is played by placing black and white stones on a
grid.<br />
<strong>Objective</strong> - The goal is to surround more territory than
your opponent. You can also score points by capturing your opponent’s
stones.<br />
<strong>Simple rules</strong> - The rules are very simple and can be
learned in a few minutes, even by four-year-olds.<br />
<strong>Handicapping system</strong> - It has a simple handicapping
system that allows children to play with adults and beginners to play
with experts, without changing the “flavor” or “feel” of the game.
<strong>This guarantees a close exciting game in which both players have
an equal chance of winning.</strong></p>
<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Because GO benefits both the individual and the community, the
mission of the <strong>Nebraska GO Advisory Council</strong> is to
promote the fun, fascinating, and educationally-beneficial game of GO in
and near the state of Nebraska. Hopefully, our existence and, moreover,
our success will be an inspiration to GO promoters beyond Nebraska.</p>
<h2 id="the-educational-benefits-of-playing-go">THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS
OF PLAYING GO</h2>
<p><strong>Research done in both the USA and South Korea has proven that
playing GO significantly IMPROVES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Performance and INCREASES</li>
<li>Task Concentration Span (“Attention”) by 54%</li>
<li>Delaying Gratification (“Patience”) by 29%</li>
<li>Problem-Solving Ability by 22%</li>
<li>It also increases Social Interaction and DECREASES Problem
Behavior</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><strong>Who wouldn’t want to live in a community with students and
adults with the above improved abilities?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Baduk is the Korean name for GO.</p>

Children’s Intelligence, Concentration, Delayed Gratification and
Problem-Solving Ability”</em>, Kyunghee University (Seoul, South Korea),

<li>This study confirms and adds to research previously done by Dr
William S Cobb of the University of Virginia in 1997, as documented in
the book, <em>“GO as Communication: The Educational and Therapeutic
Value of the Game of GO”</em> – Yasutoshi Yasuda.<br />
<strong>Excerpts, p. 40-41</strong>: “Dr. Cobb told me that
<strong>[children who had problems in controlling their emotions] often
became calm after starting to play GO and are better able to get along
with others. Their academic achievement has also improved.</strong> The
very first group to whom Dr. Cobb taught GO in a school was a group of
fourteen-year-olds who had behavioral problems and who often didn’t show
up for school. He didn’t know their reputation when he started teaching
them, and he wasn’t surprised when they were always present and sat
quietly through the sessions, concentrating on playing, but the school
staff noticed. <strong>The principal came to the class just to see what
had caused such a transformation in the students.</strong> He has also
had parents come to visit his classes, because they wanted to see what
it was that was having such a big impact on their children.”</li>
<li>Research done with preschoolers produced similar results – Andrew
Hong, 2014, Palo Alto, CA.</li>

<p>“My faculty and I firmly believe in the value of engaging students
through hands-on, minds-on learning, and the game of GO falls perfectly
in the realm of stimulating learning experience.” – <em>Joy Zhao,
Director of Academics, YingHua International School, Princeton,
NJ.</em></p>
<h2 id="vision-statement">Vision Statement</h2>
<p>To promote GO in Nebraska and the surrounding areas by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating “GO Awareness” in the general population by exposing others
to the game, so that it is as recognizable as other popular board games,
like Checkers or Chess.</li>
<li>Teaching others about GO and how to play GO.</li>
<li>Encouraging and facilitating the teaching and playing of GO.</li>
<li>Sharing the Educational and Communal Benefits and Cultural and
Historical significance of the game of GO with others, especially with
educators and parents.</li>
<li>Helping to create self-sustaining GO clubs, especially at K-12
schools, libraries, community centers, YMCAs, and colleges.</li>
<li>Creating enough GO players and GO clubs that the
<strong>NGAC</strong> is no longer necessary and can, therefore, cease
to exist, as the number of GO players and GO clubs will fulfill the
mission of the <strong>NGAC</strong> on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cooperation</strong> – To promote our vision, we look forward
to working with other passionate, like-minded, individuals and
organizations, including, but not limited to, the American Go
Association (USGO.org) and the American Go Foundation (AGFGO.org). We
are not interested in duplicating other organizations’ efforts, but in
complementing and enhancing their efforts, in order to promote GO in and
around Nebraska.</p>

<p><strong>FREE GO Presentations – We are available to do FREE one-hour
GO presentations for your group</strong>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short history of GO</li>
<li>Fun facts about the game</li>
<li>The educational and community benefits of GO, and</li>
<li>Teaching participants to play GO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The presentation, itself, takes about 20 minutes, but can be

<h2>GO vs Chess – which is better?</h2>
</section>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p>by Jim Story (imho)</p>
</div>
<p>Both GO and Chess are great mentally-challenging games. Obviously,
each games’ enthusiasts will have their own strong opinions about which
game is better and why. I, personally, have played both games seriously
for decades. For example, I’ve played in both GO and Chess tournaments,
I have been the organizer of the Omaha GO Club since 2011, and, in 1994,
I was the President of the Memphis, TN, Chess Club. Both are good games.
<strong>However, if you must choose between starting a GO club OR a
starting a Chess club, might I suggest a GO club, for the following
reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>GO is FREE</strong> – you can get FREE GO starter sets
for your K-12 school, library, YMCA, or community center GO clubs from
the AMERICAN GO FOUNDATION (www.AGFGO.org).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GO uses more of the brain</strong> – fMRI (functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies show that GO uses more of the brain
than Chess. It’s more of a whole-brain workout.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handicapping system</strong> – Unlike Chess, GO has a
simple handicapping system that allows kids to play with adults and
beginners to play with experts, without changing the “feel” or “flavor”
of the game. This allows a close exciting game in which both players
have an equal chance of winning, whatever their skill levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GO is quicker and easier to learn</strong> - The rules of
GO are simpler than the rules of Chess, so it’s quicker and easier to
learn. This is especially important for younger children. For example,
in GO, there is only one “piece”, the stone. Stones are placed on the
board one at a time and, once placed, are not moved.</p>
<p>By comparison, in Chess, there are five pieces: king, queen, bishop,
knight, and rook, plus the pawns. All move differently. And, there are
many special rules, like castling, en passant capturing, pawn promotion,
etc. GO, by comparison, has only two easily-understandable special
rules: You cannot make a move that results in either (1) the capture of
your own stones, or (2) a move that duplicates a previous position.
That’s it. Very simply rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capture GO (simplified GO)</strong> – In “regular” GO,
victory is determined by how much territory each player has surrounded
at the end of the game, plus the number of stones each player has
captured. As some beginners, especially younger children, have
difficulty envisioning how much territory each player has surrounded
with their stones as they are playing the game, there is a simplified
version of GO called, “Capture GO” that eliminates this beginner
difficulty.</p>
<p>In Capture GO, you only need keep track of how many stones you have
captured while playing. And, the first player to a preset number of
stones captured, 30 for example, wins. This is not that different from
“regular” GO, because the player who has surrounded more territory will
be the first to capture 30 stones. So, both “regular” GO and Capture GO
produce the same winner, the same result. <strong>See the rules for both
regular GO and Capture GO below.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>GO is ultimately more mentally challenging</strong> –
Even as early as the 1990’s, computers could be programmed, using
heuristics (“rules of thumb”) in combination with brute-force computing,
to beat the best Chess player in the world. However, not until 2016,
with the invention of the artificial intelligence software known as
AlphaGo, were computers able to defeat the world GO champion. So, GO
presents more of mental challenge to humans than does Chess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eventual greater complexity</strong> – GO can be played
on boards of different sizes. The larger the board, the longer the game
takes and the more complex is the interaction between the different
battles on the board. This is what makes it both exciting and
challenging. A simplified analogy would be, “If Chess is a battle, then
GO is a war with multiple battles that interact with each other”. On the
large GO board (a grid of 19 x 19, which is five times the size of a
Chess board), GO strategy is estimated to be four times as complex as
Chess. You can play a quick game of GO on a small board (e.g., on a 9 x
9) in ten minutes. But as GO players advance in skill, they like to play
on larger boards, which makes for a more complex and, therefore, more
challenging, and exciting game.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, hopefully, you can start both GO and Chess clubs at
your school, library, community center, or YMCA. However, if you can
only start one, I strongly suggest starting a GO club for the reasons
listed above. Lastly, if you can’t start a GO club, then, by all means,
please start a Chess club.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Jim</p>

<h2>The Rules of Go</h2>
</section>
<p>The written rules are below. You can also watch a YouTube video to
learn the rules. For free, kid-safe, beginner GO videos, go to: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/@WorldGoChannel"><span class="citation"
data-cites="WorldGoChannel">@WorldGoChannel</span></a> – start with the
playlist “Lessons in Logical Sequence”. The first video teaches the
rules of GO (five minutes). The second video is a sample game with
explanations (20 minutes). There are over 100 five-minute GO videos on
this YouTube channel designed specifically for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>The Rules of “CAPTURE GO”</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, regular GO counts territory and captures to
determine the winner at the END of the game. In CAPTURE GO, however, the
winner is determined DURING the game. All of the “regular” GO rules
apply with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because playing first is a huge advantage, White receives a
compensation (komi) of five captured stones at the beginning of the
game. These are placed in White’s “prison pile”, which can be the lid of
the GO bowls or just placed on White’s side of the board.</p></li>
<li><p>The winner is determined during the game by whichever player
captures 30 stones first (on a 9x9 board). It is strongly suggested that
beginners play many games on a 9x9 before progressing to larger
boards.</p></li>
<li><p>Players MUST place a stone on the board, when it is their turn.
This last rule leads to players either filling in their own territory,
or placing stones into their opponent’s territory where they can be
captured. Consequently, whoever has surrounded the most territory will
also win the game in both “regular” GO and Capture GO.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Starting position for beginners</strong> – When players first
starting playing GO, they should start on a 9x9 board by placing stones
as shown in the following diagram with Black to move first. Also, they
should play Capture GO and, initially, play until a player has captured
just ONE stone. By starting in the following position and only playing
until a player has captured just ONE stone, both players immediately
start to learn how to attack and defend. Later, they can abandon this
pre-determined placement of stones and start with an empty board and, as
stated above, White will start with five captured stones in compensation
for Black being able to move first.</p>
<p><img src="image4.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Handicap stones</strong> – When playing against beginners, it
is best to give them some handicap stones at the start of the game in
order to even out the game and give them a fighting chance. So, in
addition to starting in the above position, 1 to 4 handicap stones can
be added on the 3-3 points, as shown below. Also, I like to help a
beginner win the first few games. As they win more games and gain
competence, handicap stones can be removed one at a time. A rule we use
is: If a player wins three games in a row against the same opponent,
then, they need one less handicap stone to start the game or their
opponent needs one more handicap stone. In Capture GO, Black always
plays first, regardless of whether they receive handicap stones or
not.</p>
<p><img src="image5.png" /></p>
<h2 id="american-go-association-aga-concise-rules-of-go">American Go
Association (AGA) Concise Rules of Go</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Board and Stones:</strong> Go is a game of strategy
between two sides usually played on a 19x19 grid (the board). The game
may also be played on smaller boards, 13x13 and 9x9 being the two most
common variants. The board is initially vacant, unless a handicap is
given (see Rule 4). The two sides, known as Black and White, are each
provided with an adequate supply of playing tokens, known as stones, of
the appropriate color.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play:</strong> The players alternate in moving, with
Black playing first. In handicap games, White moves first after Black
has placed his or her handicap stones. A move consists in playing a
stone of one’s color on an empty intersection (including edges and
corners), or in passing. Certain moves are illegal (Rules 5 and 6), but
a pass is always legal (Rule 7). Points are awarded for controlling
space in a manner described below (Rule 12). The object of the game is
to end with the greater total number of points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compensation:</strong> In an even (non-handicap) game,
Black gives White a komi (compensation) of 7 ½ points for the advantage
of the first move. This komi is added to White’s score at the end of the
game. In handicap games, Black gives White ½ point compensation. This
avoids draws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Handicaps:</strong> The game may be played with a
handicap to compensate for differences in player strengths. The weaker
player takes Black, and either moves first, giving only ½ point
compensation to White, as in Rule 3 (this is known as a “one stone
handicap”), or places from 2 to 9 stones on the board before the first
White move. If the players have agreed to use area counting to score the
game (Rule 12), White receives an additional point of compensation for
each Black handicap stone after the first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capture:</strong> A liberty of a stone is a vacant,
horizontally or vertically adjacent intersection. A single stone in the
middle of an empty board has four liberties: the vacant intersections
above, below, left and right of the stone. The intersections diagonal to
the stone are not adjacent and are not counted as liberties of the
stone. A single stone on a side intersection has a maximum of three
liberties; a single stone in the corner has a maximum of two
liberties.<br />
Stones of the same color are said to be connected if they are adjacent
along horizontal or vertical lines on the board (each occupies a liberty
of the other). Two stones are part of the same string if they are linked
by a chain of connected stones of the same color. The liberties of a
string of stones are the liberties of all the individual stones in that
string.<br />
After a player moves, any stone or string of stones belonging to the
opponent which is completely surrounded by the player’s own stones,
leaving no liberties, is captured, and removed from the board. Such
stones become prisoners of the capturing player. It is illegal for a
player to move so as to create a string of his or her own stones which
is completely surrounded (without liberties) after any surrounded
opposing stones are captured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Repeated Board Position (Ko):</strong> It is illegal to
play in such a way as to exactly recreate a previous full board position
from the game, with the same player to move. The most typical example is
a situation where the players can each alternately capture and recapture
a single stone. This is known as ko. (“Ko” is the Japanese Buddhist word
for eternity.) After the first capture, the player moving next may not
recapture immediately, as this would repeat the board position; instead,
that player must play elsewhere on the board (or pass).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Passing:</strong> On his or her turn, a player may pass
by handing the opponent a stone, referred to as a pass stone, rather
than playing a stone on the board.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Illegal Moves:</strong> An illegal move is one violating
the rules. If a player makes an illegal move, it shall be taken back,
treated as a pass, and a pass stone exchanged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ending the Game:</strong> Two consecutive passes normally
signal the end of the game. After two passes, the players must attempt
to agree on the status of all groups of stones remaining on the board.
Any stones which the players agree could not escape capture if the game
continued, but which have not yet been captured and removed, are termed
dead stones. If the players agree on the status of all such groups, they
are removed from the board as prisoners of the player who could capture,
and the game is scored as in Rule 12. If there is a disagreement over
the status of some group or groups, play is resumed as specified in Rule
10.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disputes:</strong> If the players disagree about the
status of a group of stones left on the board after both have passed,
play is resumed, with the opponent of the last player to pass having the
move. The game is over when the players agree on the status of all
groups on the board, or, failing such agreement, if both players pass
twice in succession. In this case any stones remaining on the board are
deemed alive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Last Move:</strong> White must make the last move–if
necessary, an additional pass, with a stone passed to the opponent as
usual. The total number of stones played or passed by the two players
during the entire game must be equal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Counting:</strong> There are two methods for counting the
score at the end of the game. One is based on territory, the other on
area. Although players’ scores may differ under the two methods, the
difference in their scores, and the game result, will be the same.
Territory: Those empty points on the board which are entirely surrounded
by live stones of a single color are considered the territory of the
player of that color. An empty point is surrounded by stones of a single
color if one can’t reach any stone of the opposing color from that point
by moving only to adjacent empty points. There are rare situations
(Japanese seki) in which empty points are left at the end of the game
which are not entirely surrounded by stones of a single color, and which
neither player dares to fill. Area: All live stones of a player’s color
left on the board together with any points of territory surrounded by
[those stones] constitute that player’s area. Neutral Points: Any empty
points left on the board at the end of the game which are not completely
surrounded by either player’s stones are known as neutral points, and
are not counted toward either player’s territory or area.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Counting by Territory:</strong> When counting by territory,
players add up their total territory less any prisoners held by the
opponent (including dead stones removed at the end of the game). The
player with the greater total (after adjusting for any compensation
offered according to Rule 3) is the winner.</p>
<p>(It is customary for the players to fill in their opponent’s
territory with their prisoners, and to then rearrange their territories
to facilitate counting. These are merely mechanical conventions to
simplify counting.)</p>
<p><strong>Counting by Area:</strong> When counting by area, the players
add up their total area. Prisoners are ignored. The player with the
greater total area (after adjusting for any compensation offered
according to Rules 3 and 4) is the winner.</p>
