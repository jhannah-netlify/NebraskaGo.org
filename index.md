## What is Go?

GO – It’s more than a game.  It’s a game-changer.

We promote Go, not only because it’s fun to play,
but because it creates better students and better citizens,
leading to better communities. 
 
*“When I was young... I wanted to be the world's best Go player”*<br/>
--Bill Gates Speaks: Insights from the World's Most Successful Entrepreneur, p. 227.

Go is an ancient easy-to-learn strategy game.  It is played with black and
white stones on a grid.
**Simple rules** can be [learned in a few minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP63zfY-FM0&ab_channel=WorldGoChannel),
even by children as young as four. 
**Handicapping system** allows children to play with adults
and beginners to play with experts.
 
## Mission Statement

Because Go benefits both the individual and the community, the mission of the
Nebraska GO Advisory Council is to promote the fun, engaging, fascinating, and
educationally-beneficial game of Go in and near the state of Nebraska.
Hopefully, our existence and, moreover, our success will be an inspiration to
Go promoters beyond Nebraska.
 
Research done in both the USA and South Korea has proven that playing Go significantly IMPROVES:

* Academic Performance
* Task Concentration Span (“Attention”)
* Delaying Gratification (“Patience”)
* Problem-Solving Ability
* It also increases Social Interaction and DECREASES Problem Behavior
 
*Who wouldn’t want to live in a community with students and adults with the
above improved abilities?*
 
## Vision Statement

To promote Go in Nebraska and the surrounding areas by:

* Creating “Go Awareness” in the general population by exposing others to the
game, so that it is as recognizable as other popular board games, like Checkers
or Chess.
* Teaching others about Go and how to play Go.
* Encouraging and facilitating the teaching and playing of Go.
* Sharing the Educational and Communal Benefits and Cultural and Historical
significance of the game of Go with others, especially with educators and
parents.
* Helping to create self-sustaining Go clubs, especially at K-12 schools,
libraries, community centers, YMCAs, and colleges.
* Creating enough Go players and Go clubs that the NGAC is no longer necessary
and can, therefore, cease to exist, as the number of Go players and Go clubs
will fulfill the mission of the NGAC on their own.
 
**Cooperation** – To promote our vision, we look forward to working with other
passionate, like-minded, individuals and organizations, including, but not
limited to, the American Go Foundation ([www.agfGo.org](https://www.agfGo.org)).
We are not interested
in duplicating other organizations’ efforts, but in complementing and enhancing
them.  Please note that we are always looking for new NGAC members.  Ask for an
application form ([jm9st9@gmail.com](mailto:jm9st9@gmail.com)).

## Go vs Chess – which is better?

Jim Story, 4/3/2025

Obviously, avid Go players and avid Chess players will have their own opinions.
I, personally, have played both games seriously (for example, I’ve played in
both Go and Chess tournaments).  I am currently the Organizer of the Omaha Go
Club and, in 1994, was the President of the Memphis, TN, Chess Club. However,
if you’re considering starting *either* a scholastic Go *or* Chess club, I suggest
a Go club, for the following reasons:

* **Go uses more of the brain** – fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
studies show that Go uses more of the brain than Chess.

* **Handicapping system** – Unlike Chess, Go has a simple handicapping system that
allows adults to play with kids and experts to play with beginners, without
changing the “feel” or “flavor” of the game.  This allows a close exciting
game in which both players have an equal chance of winning, whatever their
skills levels.

* **Go is easier to learn** - The rules of Go are simpler than the rules of Chess,
so it’s easier to learn.  This is especially important for younger children.
For example, in Go, there is only one “piece”, the stone.  Stones are placed
on the board one at a time and, once placed, are not moved.  By comparison,
in Chess, there are five pieces: king, queen, bishop, knight, and rook, plus
the pawns.  All move differently.  And, there are many special rules, like
castling, en passant capturing, pawn promotion, and, while pawns move
forward, they can only capture diagonally.  Go, by comparison, has only two
easily-understandable special rules:  You cannot make a move that results in
either the capture of your own stones, or one that duplicates that previous
position.

* **Eventual greater complexity** – Go can be played on different sized boards.  The
larger the board, the longer the game takes and the more complex is the
interaction between different battles on the board.  This is what makes it both
exciting and challenging.  On the tournament board (a grid of 19 x 19, which is
five times the size of a Chess board), Go is estimated to be four times as
complex as Chess.  You can play a quick and simple game of Go on a small board
(e.g., on a 9 x 9).  But, as Go players advance, they like to play on
larger-sized boards, which makes for a more complex and, therefore, more
challenging and exciting game.

In conclusion, hopefully, you can start both a Go and a Chess club at your
school.  However, if you can only start one, I strongly suggest starting a Go
club.  Lastly, if you don’t start a Go club, then, by all means, please start a
Chess club.
